Terrible attempt at solving a jigsaw puzzle

## why?
Started with reading a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StuffMadeHere/comments/wi9nsn/inspired_by_shane_i_made_this_jigzilla_software/ "StuffMadeHere post") that challenged to solving this puzzle.

## goal

Learn CV2 better and image processing in general.

I thought if I could first find the flat edges, then I could start with those and find which other edges would fit into them. Getting flat edges is harder than I thought, contours don't contain the minimum number of points (after you rotate them) so I have to go back and learn cv2 much better than I thought I knew it.

I also bet there are bunch of nicer ways and looking forward to learning those (if possible).
